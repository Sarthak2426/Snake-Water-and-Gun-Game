# Snake-Water-and-Gun-Game

Welcome to the Snake Water Gun Game! This is a simple and fun game you can play against the computer. The game is similar to "Rock Paper Scissors" but with a twist. You get to choose between Snake, Water, and Gun. The rules are as follows:

Snake drinks Water, so Snake wins against Water.
Water douses Gun, so Water wins against Gun.
Gun shoots Snake, so Gun wins against Snake.
If both you and the computer choose the same item, it's a tie.
